## S3 Bucket ACL Allows Read Or Write to All Users
**File:** `./test_data/iac_example/main.tf`

**Severity:** `CRITICAL`  
**Line:** `3`  
**Description:** S3 Buckets should not be readable and writable to all users

### Explanation & Fix:
This issue means that the permissions for your Amazon S3 bucket, as configured in your Terraform file, are currently set to allow read or write access to anyone. This is a critical security vulnerability because it means that potentially confidential information in your S3 bucket could be accessed and even modified by unauthorized users. 

The warning is issued for the code in your 'main.tf' file in the directory mentioned above. Specifically, the problem exists at line 3 in the code. The recommendation is to update your access control list (ACL) settings, so the S3 bucket is not readable and writable to all users. 

Here is an example of how you might modify your code to ensure secure access to your S3 bucket:

Bad Terraform Code:
```
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "b" {
  bucket = "my_bucket_name"
  acl    = "public-read-write"
}
```
Corrected Terraform Code:
```
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "b" {
  bucket = "my_bucket_name"
  acl    = "private"
}
```
In this modification, the ACL is changed from 'public-read-write' (allowing anyone to read and write to the bucket), to 'private' – ensuring only authorized users who are explicitly granted access can read or write to this S3 bucket.

## S3 Bucket Logging Disabled
**File:** `./test_data/iac_example/main.tf`

**Severity:** `MEDIUM`  
**Line:** `1`  
**Description:** Server Access Logging should be enabled on S3 Buckets so that all changes are logged and trackable

### Explanation & Fix:
In simple terms, the issue is that the S3 bucket (a type of storage system in Amazon Web Services) specified in your Terraform file does not have logging enabled. This is a problem because it means that any actions performed on that S3 bucket, such as adding or removing data, are not being recorded. It's important that these actions are logged so there's a record of all changes, allowing you to track who has accessed the data and when.

In order to fix this, you can modify your Terraform script to enable logging on the S3 bucket. Here's an example of how to do it:

```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "b" {
  bucket = "bucket-name"
  acl    = "private"

  logging {
    target_bucket = "logging-bucket-name"
    target_prefix = "log/"
  }
 }
```
In this example, you must replace "bucket-name" with the name of the bucket where the activity is, and replace "logging-bucket-name" with the name of the second bucket where logs will be saved. The "target_prefix" option allows you to specify a prefix for all log files. For instance, if it's set to "log/", then all your log files will be stored in a folder named "log" in your logging bucket. Please note that the logging bucket must already be created before applying this script.

## S3 Bucket Without Versioning
**File:** `./test_data/iac_example/main.tf`

**Severity:** `MEDIUM`  
**Line:** `1`  
**Description:** S3 bucket should have versioning enabled

### Explanation & Fix:
The issue identified here is that the Amazon S3 storage service (bucket) created using Terraform does not have versioning enabled. Versioning is a feature provided by Amazon S3 which keeps all versions of an object (including all writes and deletes) in the bucket. This means that you can preserve, retrieve, and restore every version of every object in your bucket which protects against both unintended deletions and uploads.

Versioning should be enabled for proper data backup, easy rollback, and to protect against accidental deletion.

Here's how to update the Terraform code to enable versioning on the S3 bucket:

Current buggy code:
```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "bucket" {
  bucket = "bucket_name"
  acl    = "private"

  tags = {
    Name        = "Bucket"
    Environment = "Dev"
  }
}
```

Updated secure code:
```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "bucket" {
  bucket = "bucket_name"
  acl    = "private"

  versioning {
    enabled = true
  }

  tags = {
    Name        = "Bucket"
    Environment = "Dev"
  }
}
```
In the updated code, I added a `versioning` block with a parameter `enabled` set to `true` within the `aws_s3_bucket` resource block. This will ensure that versioning is enabled for the specified S3 bucket.

## IAM Access Analyzer Not Enabled
**File:** `./test_data/iac_example/main.tf`

**Severity:** `LOW`  
**Line:** `1`  
**Description:** IAM Access Analyzer should be enabled and configured to continuously monitor resource permissions

### Explanation & Fix:
The issue here is related to a security tool in AWS known as the IAM Access Analyzer. The IAM Access Analyzer monitors your resource permissions in AWS to ensure that they are not unintentionally granting access to resources that should be private. In this case, the problem is that IAM Access Analyzer isn't turned on.

A person less acquainted with cybersecurity and cloud infrastructure might understand it this way: it's as if you had a burglar alarm system in your house but you forgot to turn it on. Now, if a burglar were to enter your house, your alarm system wouldn't be able to alert you.

The Terraform code in the file main.tf (which is essentially a script for setting up cloud infrastructure) should be modified to properly enable and configure the IAM Access Analyzer.

Here is a quick remediation for this issue:

To create an Analyzer with Terraform, you can use the aws_accessanalyzer_analyzer resource. Please make sure the provider version is up to date for using this.

```terraform
provider "aws" {
  version = "~> 3.33"
  region  = "us-west-2"
}

resource "aws_accessanalyzer_analyzer" "analyzer" {
  analyzer_name = "example-analyzer"
  type          = "ACCOUNT"
}
```
This code will create an IAM Access Analyzer with the name "example-analyzer" in your AWS account. The type of analyzer being created is set to "ACCOUNT", specifying that it is to be used to analyze resources in your account.

Remember to replace the provider region to yours and to customize the analyzer name as required. After making these changes, you run terraform apply to create the resource.

Please note that it’s important to appropriately manage permissions on the Analyzer. By default, IAM Access Analyzer’s permissions to read resources' policy is granted by the resource-based policies. If your resources are defined with restrictive resource-based policies, you will need to update these policies to allow the Analyzer to analyze your resources.
