## S3 Bucket ACL Allows Read Or Write to All Users
**File:** `../../input/main.tf`

**Severity:** `CRITICAL`  
**Line:** `3`  
**Description:** S3 Buckets should not be readable and writable to all users

### Explanation & Fix:
This issue means that the access control list (ACL) for an S3 bucket in your Terraform file is set up in a way that allows any user to read or write to the bucket. This is considered a critical security risk because it exposes your data to potential unauthorized access and modification.

Here's how you could modify your Terraform code to fix the issue. You will need to set your S3 bucket ACL to `private`. This will ensure that only specific users that you authorize can access the bucket.

Here is an example of how you can securely configure your S3 bucket:

```tf
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "bucket" {
  bucket = "your bucket name"
  acl    = "private"

  tags = {
    Name        = "My bucket"
    Environment = "Prod"
  }
}
```
Remember to replace "your bucket name" with the actual name of your bucket. The above code will create an S3 bucket that is only accessible to users that you specifically grant access to.

## S3 Bucket Logging Disabled
**File:** `../../input/main.tf`

**Severity:** `MEDIUM`  
**Line:** `1`  
**Description:** Server Access Logging should be enabled on S3 Buckets so that all changes are logged and trackable

### Explanation & Fix:
The issue is that server access logging for your S3 Bucket is not enabled. This logging is important because it records all the changes made to your S3 buckets and allows you to monitor any potential security breaches. Currently, your Terraform file has it disabled, which is flagged as a moderate-risk issue.

To fix this, you need to enable server access logging in your Terraform file with the "logging" argument. Here's a sample secure Terraform code:

```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "bucket" {
  bucket = "mybucket"
  acl    = "private"

  logging {
    target_bucket = "logging_bucket"
    target_prefix = "log/"
  }
}
```
With this fix, the access logs for "mybucket" will be stored in the "logging_bucket" S3 bucket in a "log/" directory.

## S3 Bucket Without Versioning
**File:** `../../input/main.tf`

**Severity:** `MEDIUM`  
**Line:** `1`  
**Description:** S3 bucket should have versioning enabled

### Explanation & Fix:
This issue is telling you that the code for the S3 bucket in your Terraform file is not secure because it doesn't have versioning enabled. Versioning in an S3 bucket keeps multiple versions of an object in the same bucket, which can help you restore older versions of an object or even recover deleted ones. Not having versioning enabled can potentially result in loss of data.

Here's an example of how you can modify your Terraform file to enable versioning on S3 bucket.

Current Terraform code (has issue):
```terraform
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "bucket" {
  bucket = "bucket-name"
}
```
Secure Terraform code (fixed issue):
```terraform
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "bucket" {
  bucket = "bucket-name"

  versioning {
    enabled = true
  }
}
```

As you can see, I've added a versioning block inside the S3 bucket resource and set "enabled" to true. This will ensure that every time you modify an object in this bucket, AWS will keep the older versions, making it possible for you to revert changes or recover deleted objects.

## IAM Access Analyzer Not Enabled
**File:** `../../input/main.tf`

**Severity:** `LOW`  
**Line:** `1`  
**Description:** IAM Access Analyzer should be enabled and configured to continuously monitor resource permissions

### Explanation & Fix:
In plain English, this issue is highlighting that in your Infrastructure as Code (IaC) configuration file (main.tf file) you're not using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) Access Analyzer. 

IAM Access Analyzer is a service in AWS that helps you to ensure your AWS resources are not unintentionally shared globally or with unintended entities. It does so by continuously analyzing the permissions attached to your resources.

To fix this issue, we need to enable and configure IAM Access Analyzer through Terraform in your main.tf file. Below is a sample code on how you can accomplish this:

```hcl
resource "aws_iam_access_analyzer" "example" {
  analyzer_name = "example"
  type          = "ACCOUNT"
  
  tags = {
    Name        = "example"
    Environment = "prod"
  }
}
```

This example code creates an IAM Access Analyzer named 'example'. The type of the analyzer is 'ACCOUNT' meaning it is associated with the AWS Account. You can customize the tags according to your needs. 

Remember to replace 'example' and 'prod' with the actual name and environment that suits your setup. Please double-check your access and permissions before enabling the Access Analyzer as this service requires necessary rights to scan your AWS resources.
