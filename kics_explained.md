## üîç S3 Bucket ACL Allows Read Or Write to All Users (CRITICAL)
**File:** `./test_data/iac_example/main.tf`  
**Line:** `3`  
**Description:** S3 Buckets should not be readable and writable to all users

**Explanation:** In simple terms, the problem identified is within a Terraform file that configures an Amazon S3 bucket. The configuration currently allows any user to read or write data in the S3 bucket, which is a major security flaw. This means, any person, irrespective of whether they have authorized access to your information or not, are given permissions to view and also potentially alter the information stored in the bucket.

A fix for this issue is to ensure that the ACL (Access Control Lists) defined for this S3 bucket does not allow "read" or "write" permissions to all users. Here's a sample of how the corrected Terraform code might look:

```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "bucket" {
  bucket = "my-bucket"
  acl    = "private"

  tags = {
    Name        = "my-bucket"
    Environment = "Test"
  }
}
```

In this updated code, 'acl = "private"' restricts access to the bucket only to the AWS account that created the bucket. This means that users must specifically be granted access in order to read or write to the bucket. This is more secure, as it prevents unauthorized users from accessing, much less altering the data stored within this S3 bucket.

Please note to replace "my-bucket" and the tag values according to the actual bucket name and tags you're using for your specific use case.

## üîç S3 Bucket Logging Disabled (MEDIUM)
**File:** `./test_data/iac_example/main.tf`  
**Line:** `1`  
**Description:** Server Access Logging should be enabled on S3 Buckets so that all changes are logged and trackable

**Explanation:** The issue here is that your Amazon S3 Bucket, which is configured using Terraform, does not have server access logging enabled. This is a security flaw as it means that changes to the S3 Bucket are not being recorded, which can hinder efficiency and security. If incidents occur, it is critical to have logs to help investigate the root cause and take remediation actions.

Here's a fix for this in your Terraform files. The key part is the "logging" block under "aws_s3_bucket" resource. This code sets up logging for the given bucket. Replace `bucket_name` and `log_bucket_name` with the names of your actual buckets.

```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "bucket" {
  bucket = "bucket_name"
  acl    = "private"

  logging {
    target_bucket = "log_bucket_name"
    target_prefix = "log/"
  }
}
```
In this secure code fix, "target_bucket" is where your logs will be stored, and "target_prefix" is the prefix for all log files. This code ensures every event occurring with respect to the S3 bucket is recorded and stored.

## üîç S3 Bucket Without Versioning (MEDIUM)
**File:** `./test_data/iac_example/main.tf`  
**Line:** `1`  
**Description:** S3 bucket should have versioning enabled

**Explanation:** Issue:
The issue identified is within a Terraform file, specifically referring to an Amazon S3 bucket that doesn't have a versioning feature enabled. 

The versioning feature in S3 allows you to preserve, retrieve, and restore every version of every object in your bucket. Hence, in terms of security, it's important as it protects against both unintended user actions and application failures. 

Fix: 
To address this, we need to enable versioning by adding the following block of code to our Terraform file under the respective s3 bucket declaration.

```
versioning {
    enabled = true
}
```
So, our secure Terraform code for an S3 bucket should look something like this:

```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "bucket" {
  bucket = "bucket-name"
  acl    = "private"

  versioning {
    enabled = true
  }
}
```
In this block of code, we have an AWS S3 bucket with versioning enabled, which will help to keep track of and manage multiple versions of an object in a bucket. This serves as a safeguard towards any unintended user actions and application failures. The acl (access control list) is set to 'private' restricting unauthorized access to the bucket.

## üîç IAM Access Analyzer Not Enabled (LOW)
**File:** `./test_data/iac_example/main.tf`  
**Line:** `1`  
**Description:** IAM Access Analyzer should be enabled and configured to continuously monitor resource permissions

**Explanation:** This issue is saying that in your Terraform configuration file (main.tf) you do not have IAM Access Analyzer enabled. IAM stands for Identity and Access Management and is an AWS service that helps you manage access to your AWS resources.

IAM Access Analyzer is a feature of IAM that helps you to check your policies for unintended access. Essentially, it will continuously monitor the permissions on your AWS resources so that if anything were to change unexpectedly ‚Äì or you added a policy that granted wider access than you'd intended ‚Äì you'd be aware of it.

The fact that it isn't enabled in your Terraform script is a security risk, even though it's of low severity. 

To address this issue, you have to enable AWS IAM Access Analyzer.

Below is an example of how to incorporate IAM Access Analyzer through Terraform:

```hcl
resource "aws_iam_access_analyzer" "example" {
  analyzer_name = "example"
  type          = "ACCOUNT"
}
```

This bit of code will enable an access analyzer on your account. Just replace "example" with the preferred name for the analyzer.

Just ensure that you have the necessary permission to enable it and also manage the necessary resources and services in AWS. Make sure to include this bit of code into your main 'main.tf' file and apply the changes via Terraform.
